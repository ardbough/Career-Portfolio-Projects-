This is collection of projects as part of my career portfolio. 
The first project is a dashboard based on Forum Research 2018 Ontario Election survey data that I did as a part of my coursework for the Research Analyst program at Humber College.
I've included it in both .pbix and .pdf formats.
This field will be updated as I add more projects to this portfolio.
